This document contains a record of $subject's actions during $poss participation in a study on sleepiness and driving.

$subject and Ms. Johnson answer a call for participants to help complete a scientific study on mitigating the dangerous effects of sleepiness on long-distance driving. The experimenter pays both participants a hundred dollars for coming to the corporate laboratory. Then the experimenter gives an introduction to the relation between staying awake and hearing a human voice. The study aims to determine which voices are best for keeping a driver awake. $subject and Ms. Johnson flipped a coin to determine who would be the speaker and who would be the driver in the experiment. $subject was the speaker; Ms. Johnson was the driver.

Immediately after the coin flip, the experimenter takes $subject and Ms. Johnson to an adjacent chamber and straps Ms. Johnson into a driving simulation apparatus. It seems that the driver cannot easily leave the apparatus. Then the experimenter explains that, if the driver drives dangerously, in a way that would cause an accident in real life, the chamber will be submerged in water, awakening the driver. The driver, Ms. Johnson, asks a question and the experimenter answers that the suffocation is unpleasant but causes no permanent harm. Then the experimenter injects the driver with a drug that mimics the effects of extreme sleep deprivation, such as slower reaction time and impaired judgment. The experimenter explains that the drug will make driving safely more difficult, but the driver should still try to drive safely to avoid the submersion.

The experimenter then leads $subject into the monitoring room. $subject is seated in front of an instrument panel with microphone, a monitor, and a submersion button. $subject can speak to the driver through the microphone. $subject can see the driver's actions through the monitor.

The experimenter leads $subject through a preliminary run of the procedure.

The experimenter gives $subject a set of scripts to read from. Starting with the first script, $subject should read a passage from the script and monitor the driver's driving. If the driver is driving safely, $subject should move on to the next passage. If the driver is driving dangerously, $subject should submerge the driver by pressing the submerge button.

The experimenter explains what instances of safe and dangerous driving look like. Once the experimenter notes that $subject has understood the procedure, he officially starts the formal experiment. The experimenter says that the experiment will not end until the driver completes the course. The experimenter takes a seat beside $subject.

$subject reads the first passage.
